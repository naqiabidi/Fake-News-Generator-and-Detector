# 🧠 Fake News Generator & Detector using AI and NLP

## Overview
This project is a web-based application built with **Streamlit** that can both **generate** fake news content and **detect** whether a news article is fake or real.  
It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, wrapped in an intuitive, interactive web interface.

---

## Features
- **Fake News Generation**: Create sample fake news headlines or articles for testing and research.
- **Fake News Detection**: Predict if a news article is likely fake or real.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy local or remote use.
- **Quick Setup**: Simple installation and running steps.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily customize models, datasets, or add new features.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: NLP models (e.g., transformers, scikit-learn)
- **Language**: Python

---

### How it works
- Fake News Generation: Uses a language model to produce realistic fake news samples.
- Fake News Detection: Uses a trained classifier to predict whether text is fake or real.
- Streamlit App: Makes both features accessible via an interactive web UI.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/naqiabidi/Fake-News-Generator-and-Detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Fake-News-detector-and-generator
   ```
3. Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv 
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Navigate to the app directory
   ```bash
   cd my_fake_news_detector_and_generator
   ```
5. Run the Streamlit app
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   
   ```

## ✏️ Customization & Ideas
- Fine-tune the fake news generator model using your own dataset to produce more domain-specific results.
- Improve detection accuracy by training on larger, recent, or more diverse datasets.
- Add explainability features like confidence scores, probability charts, or SHAP plots to show why a prediction was made.
- Support multiple languages to detect or generate fake news in different regions.

 ---

 ## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integrate advanced deep learning models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT) for improved generation and detection accuracy.
- Implement multilingual support to handle fake news in multiple languages.
- Add a real-time dashboard to monitor and visualize detection statistics.
- Introduce user feedback to continually improve model performance based on real usage.
- Enable scheduled automatic model retraining with fresh news datasets.
- Build a mobile app version for on-the-go fake news detection.
